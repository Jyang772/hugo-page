Their size was the reason they were so expensive: they required a lot of custom components that had to be very carefully assembled in the macro-world, by people holding advanced degrees in electrical engineering, in a process that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be scaled up for mass production.</description></item><item><title>Programming Languages</title><link>https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/complexity/languages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/complexity/languages/</guid><description>If you are reading this book, then somewhere on your computer science journey you had a moment when you first started to care about the efficiency of your code.
Mine was in high school, when I realized that making websites and doing useful programming won&amp;rsquo;t get you into a university, and entered the exciting world of algorithmic programming olympiads. I was an okay programmer, especially for a highschooler, but I had never really wondered how much time it took for my code to execute before.</description></item></channel></rss>
